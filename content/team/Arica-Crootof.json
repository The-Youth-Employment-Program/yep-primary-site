  "bio": "Arica Crootof is an Associate Professor of Environmental Sustainability at the University of Montana Western. Students in her classes engage in local river restoration, green building, and range land research in collaboration with the Youth Employment Program.\n\nIn Environmental Sustainability, Dr Crootof explains, it is important that students get out of the classroom setting and experience the challenges that arise when working to implement conservation projects. Equally important, is having students grow through these challenges and experience the social and land connections that develop through this fieldwork.\n\nDr. Crootof brings expertise in water management and sustainability science along with a dedication to environmental education and mentorship to the Youth Employment Program Board.
