  "blurb": "I was born and raised on the family ranch in Grasshopper Valley here in Beaverhead County.  I participated in many youth activities, especially 4-H and FFA.  Since the age of 8 years old, Range Judging has been a big part of developing who I am today.  I have judged and won in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Oklahoma.  I attend Montana State University and earned a Bachelor of Range Science Resource Option with a Minor in Animal Science.  While in college, I was active in 5 organizations and held several officer positions.  A member of the Plant ID and URME (Undergraduate Range Management Exam) team for 2 years and was selected as Top Range Student in 1995. Upon finishing college, I was fortunate to return to the family ranch, where I am today.  Since that time, I have volunteered my time to be part of various community and Statewide organizations.  While on the BLM RAC (Resource Advisory Council), I served as Chair and Vice Chair.  I’m currently on the State Steering Committee for Montana Range Days and served as the local committee Chairman after Covid.  I enjoy helping youth in learning to develop their skills and feel it is vital we give back to the community we live. A saying I like to live by is “One has to be honest to God before one can be honest to themselves or anybody else in this world”.  This saying coupled with “Communication” can solve many problems that may arise for anyone.",
