Since learning how to motivate myself, I wanted to teach the students that anyone can be a leader regardless of the position. Moving a team towards a common goal is a leadership quality. While working for The Youth Employment Program, I learned how to effectively lead a crew and make sure everyone is enjoying their time while putting in quality effort and work. These new skills that I learned will help me in a professional setting as I strive for a position within the field of conservation.\n\nThank you",
