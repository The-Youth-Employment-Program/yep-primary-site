We are always looking for chances to be able to broaden the skill sets that we can offer. It is important that individuals such as the local youth that we work with, are able to be exposed to various career paths and have as much opportunity as they can to be able to exceed in their professional career journey.\n\n##### It is the support of the community that allows us to expand on the opportunities that we are able to provide to others.&#xA;&#xA;If you'd like to write YEP a check, we will send a donation receipt. You can specify how your funds may be spent via the memo line, be sure to include a specific use, project, or list as 'general use'\n",
